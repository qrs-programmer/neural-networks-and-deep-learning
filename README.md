# Neural Network Digit Recognizer – Learning Project

## Overview
This project is a self-directed learning exercise based on *[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)* by Michael Nielsen. Through this online book, I'm gaining an intuitive and mathematical understanding of neural networks, as well as curiosity to dive deeper into deep learning concepts. Essentially, this repository serves as a way to tinker around with and enrich my understanding of concepts explained in Michael Nielson's book.

The repository contains:  
- A forked neural network implementation from the book’s reference code  
- Optimizations to improve mini-batch training performance using **vectorized, matrix-based gradient computations**  
- A simple web interface allowing users to draw digits and receive predictions from the neural network  

## Learning Goals
Through this project, I am:  
- Studying the fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning  
- Practicing problem-solving through exercises and programming tasks from the book  
- Exploring techniques to improve neural network training efficiency  
- Connecting theory to practice by building an interactive digit recognition demo  

## Features
- Draw digits in the browser and get real-time predictions from the neural network  
- Optimized training using **matrix-based mini-batch operations**, reducing epoch training time by approximately 4×  
- Clear separation between the neural network logic and frontend interface  

## Technologies
- **Backend / NN:** Python, NumPy  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React (simple drawing interface)  

## Concepts Explored
- Perceptrons and sigmoid neurons
- Feedforward neural networks and activation functions
- Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent 
- Backpropagation and gradient computation
- Using quadratic cost function vs cross-entropy cost function   
- Connecting theoretical exercises to working code
